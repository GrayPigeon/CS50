Do not access any of these solutions unless you are NOT taking the course or have already completed the problem. This is against CS50's academic honesty policy, and breaking this policy will result in harsh punishment. But possibly more significantly you would be damaging your future as a programmer and hindering your learning by copying others.

Overall, I thought this course was great. I would highly reccomend this course to all beginners (who preferably have some basic programming knowledge), and even everyone else who doesn't have experience with low-level programming, which is taught in the first 5 weeks of the course. The teacher, David Malan, was also very good, as you would expect from Harvard. 

Extra thoughts: The problem sets are significantly harder than what would be anticipated. The lectures seem so much easier compared to how difficult and complex some psets are. However, the complex psets teach students to do their own research and figure out problems on their own. Nothing in this course involves following along with the teacher, and follows a much more assignment/project-based learning, instead of just mindlessly copything what the instructor says. 

To reiterate, this is a computer science course. More than anything, concepts are taught. The actual languages are taught at a relatively shallow level, but the concepts of computer science are not.
