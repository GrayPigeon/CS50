**DISCLAIMER** 

Do not access any of these solutions unless you are not taking the course or have already completed the problem. This is against CS50's academic honesty policy, and breaking this policiy will result in harsh punishment. But possibly more significantly you would be damaging your future as a programmer and hindering your learning by copying others.

Please see CS50's [Academic Honesty Policy](https://docs.cs50.net/2016/fall/syllabus/cs50.html#academic-honesty)

I offer some thoughts in a README for each assignment that I completed, and I thought the course as a whole was great.
