# CS50
When enrolling in this course, you can choose the free option or the paid option ($90) where you will get a certificate of completion at the end if you have a passing grade. 
I am choosing the free option first, because who knows if I will be able to finish it or not.

If I do finish it, I will probably re-enroll afterwards for the paid version, where I will just copy and paste all of the solutions that I have here on my github so I can get the certificate of completion and put it on my college resume. 

If you are reading this, that means that I have already completed this course for free, and then re-completed it and got the cerrtificate of completion (I will not publicize solutions before I complete the course because of the irrational fear of plagairism). 

I have heard nothing but great things from this course, and I will be sure to offer my thoughts eventually.

This is the only time I will ever use 'new-line curly braces,' as it is mandated :/
