**Cash (Easier Assignment)**

Instructions (paraphrased): 
  1. Implement a program that first asks the user how much change is owed.
  2. Print the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made.
  3. If the user fails to provide a non-negative value, your program should re-prompt the user for a valid amount again and again until the user complies.
  
    Example: 

    Change owed: 0.41
    Minimum number of coins: 4
    
    In this example, change can be made using the least amount of coins by using one quarter, one dime, one nickel, and one penny.
