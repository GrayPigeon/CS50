**Credit (Harder Assignment)**

Instructions (paraphrased): 
  1. Implement a program that determines whether a provided credit card number is valid according to Luhnâ€™s algorithm.

```
Example: 
  Number: 4003600000000014
  Output: VISA
```

Note: Unsurprisingly, this assignment was much easier in Python than in C. Although I will admit that I definetly had a much better design for this problem, so that definetly would have helped. I didn't experience many setbacks with this one.
