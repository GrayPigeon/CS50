Note: I wish I completed this problem using functions. I underestimated how long (and hard) this problem was. My code was complete garbage. I had at least 10 counter variables and everything is so difficult to read. When I was adding comments after I completed the task, I couldn't even read my own code. If you are legitamately using this code for you own purposes, I am very sorry for the code is actually terrible. I had to use some creative solutions for some problems of this program, and they would be very tedious for anyone else to try to understand.
