**Hello**

Instructions (paraphrased): 
  1. Implement a program that prompts a user for their name, and then prints hello, so-and-so, where so-and-so is their provided name, exactly as you did in Problem Set 1, except that your program this time should be written in python.
  
Note: This is technically the first assignment that is written in Python.
