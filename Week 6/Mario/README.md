**Mario (Harder Assignment)**

Instructions:  
  1. Implement a program that prints out a double half-pyramid of a prompted height.
  
```
Exmample: 
  Height: 4
     #  #
    ##  ##
   ###  ###
  ####  ####
```

Note: I've written programs similar to this even before CS50 in Java and such, and every time I hate this program. Working with nested for loops is not one of my skills. But with Python, I paid barely any attention to what I was doing and didn't even have to implement any nested for loops. Python is great. Also I only did the harder assignment since it's practically just adds on to the easier assignment.
