Insturctions (paraphrased):
1. Write a program that takes text input from the user
2. The amount of letters, words, and sentences should be calculated
3. Use the Coleman-Liau formula to calculate the reading level of the text

```
Example: 
  Text: Congratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!
  OUtput: Grade 3
```

Note: This program was very quick and quite easy, particularly with Python.
